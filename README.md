# Tera

*This is a fork of [Tera](https://github.com/Keats/tera).*

*The only purpose is granular dependency management, so we can use most of Tera's builtin features without ones 
that depends on the [chrono](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono) crate because of security vulnerabilities in the 
latter.*

*There is a plan to introduce such dependency management in the next version of `Tera`, then we remove this fork.*
